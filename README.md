# NoGo45
A game about starting with nothing, my entry for Ludum Dare 45.

## Introduction
Everything in the game needs to be purchased, including the levels and the character.  Everything is rewarded, so all
actions and achievements gain the player points to spend.  The initial action is to open the upgrade menu for one point
with which they can buy movement controls, using the controls for the first time gives them points etc.

The game will follow a basic 'get past the enemies' style level, enemies getting more and more powerful as the game goes
on.  Purchases will go from basics to more powerful weapon(s) and defenses, finally ending in overpowered items such as
jetpacks and atom bomb.

## Thoughts on the theme
Will fill this in post-weekend, stay tuned.
